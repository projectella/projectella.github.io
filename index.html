            <h2>Letter</h2>

            <div id="letter">
                <p>Ma chérie Fleur,</p>

                <p>So I see that you have completed my little puzzle. You might have noticed that each of the four parts represents a milestone in our relationship. The first, Paris, marks our early conversations. When we met all those years ago, we spared each other not a moment's thought. We at most acknowledged each other's existence. You were certainly attractive. I was quite understandably a catch (not to brag). But our mutual interest ended there.</p>

                <p>When we reconnected after the pandemic, we began exchanging pleasantries. A few short seconds of conversation now and then. There quickly came the point that I just knew. Nothing else was clearer. You hated me. Or perhaps less dramatically, you disliked me. You challenged me, raised your attack eyebrows, refused to start conversation with me. Now, I knew I couldn't let that happen. If you were upset with me, I would have to know why. So thus began my crusade to discover your vendetta against me. I thought of topics to discuss, opportunities to talk. I finally came up with the perfect line: talk about Dune. To be honest, I hadn't enjoyed the book as much I'd hoped, but I'd be damned if it didn't come in handy for at least something.</p>

                <p>Well, it worked. Soon enough, I began answering your statuses (stati?), which proved to be brilliant conversation starters. Enter your post about Paris, which generated a good, long discussion at the time. Following those exchanges, we fell in love quite by accident. I had no intention of starting a relationship before I left for the States, and I'm sure neither did you. But having firmly established that you did <i>not</i>, in fact, hate me, there was no going back. It was Montagues and Capulets, except much less dramatic and far, far less annoying.</p>

                <p>The second represents the first time we truly expressed our commitment to each other. Indirectly, you told me first. You presented to me that poem by Shakespeare. "Never doubt I love." More directly, we said it first through message. A "je t'aime" on my end and an "eu também te amo" on yours. It didn't solve all our problems. I was still uncertain whether you really did enjoy spending time with me. But I knew then that it would all be worth it in the end. I made a promise to you and to myself that whatever happens &mdash; through the ups and downs in love and in life &mdash; I wouldn't give up without a fight. Those immortal words were promptly engraved in the rings we wear now (though engraved incorrectly in my case). When I delivered the rings, I told you that silver comes from merging neutron stars and exploding suns like our own. I told you that in the vast purpose of the formation, destruction, and recombination of elements that resulted in the mineral deposits giving rise to our rings &mdash; in the purpose of all that time, space, and matter &mdash; there is nothing nobler than what we dedicated it to. Because what we have transcends the physical and temporal. What we have could be felt across the Universe and span its many billions of years without wavering. Not because our love is perfect. Not because our love is indestructible. But because our love exists in the minds of two souls &mdash; and nothing at all can take it away from us.</p>

                <p>The third represents our time apart. In the song I wrote for your, "Every Time Around," I said "It could be Switzerland or Rome\ Invariably, immutably\ You'll always be my home." In another song, I said "I'm traveling the world\ Whenever we meet" and "You're wherever I am\ And wherever is where I'll be." In other words, the wide world we live in calls me to explore. I study in the States. I look towards Europe to extend my career. I plan to dedicate my service back to our friends in Latin America and beyond. And I plan to see the rest of the world in snapshots, unceasingly. Not only do you not make me hesitant to travel, you make the prospect of adventure all the more enthralling &mdash; "I'm traveling the world whenever we meet." Some of these journeys, certainly, we will face apart. But as long as we have each other to fall back to and as long as we have each other to call home, then "you're wherever I am and wherever is where I'll be." When I lived in Utah, I often felt scared and alone. So many things were happening, many of them new, many of them difficult. And you made them all endurable, because I knew you were going to be there to see me through them. You gave me the strength where I thought I had none left.</p>

                <p>The fourth is a hopeful thought about the future. It is impossible to know for certain what lies ahead. What the nature of our relationship will be. The timescale during which things will happen. I don't know if I ever will propose on Jungfraujoch or honeymoon on the Hawaiian islands. But to me, the future is a mess of specifics. I know what I want and the path I need to follow. I embark on a long and winding road, without knowing where it will take me. But I know that despite sure hardships, the end will be good and well worth it. The journey will be harsh at times, but can mostly be pleasant. So I'm optimistic. I sincerely hope you will follow the same road with me as we have for the past year. I hope we will have a safe journey and that the path will be kind. I hope more things will unite us than can bring us apart. All I can strive to have is hope, but there's plenty to go around.</p>

                <p>In these four pillars is a rough sketch of our story so far. Our humble beginnings, our commitment, our patience, and our hope. these pillars have each brought me so much joy and so much heartache in their own right. It would be a terrible misjudgment to say our story has been easy. And yet, it would be a grave mistake to say we were unlucky. These pillars give our story a solid foundation. We know how we started and we know how to keep going. All we have to do is trust and keep pushing onward.</p>

                <p>Manu, I love you. I am dedicated to you. I spend more time thinking and worrying about you than I do about myself. A year is no short amount of time, but I feel like, looking back, we've been together always. My sincere hope is that we will be together always looking forward as well.</p>

                <p>A very happy first year anniversary to you, mon amour.</p>

                <p>Love you uncountably,<br />
